= Test

This projectâ€™s sole purpose is to provide a remote Git repository that can be used for testing gems
like the following:

* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/milestoner[Milestoner]
* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/gemsmith[Gemsmith]

Other gems, Ruby projects, etc. might leverage this project in the future too. Any activity on this
project will mostly be the result of automated testing. In other words, not much to see here.
